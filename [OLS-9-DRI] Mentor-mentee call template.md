## **Guidelines for mentoring sessions**

-   **Schedule**

    -   Mentoring groups/individuals will meet with mentors once every
        other week. Each session can be planned between 30 (for
        individuals) to 60 minutes long (for mentoring groups).

    -   The first mentoring session should be scheduled for the week of
        October 21, 2024.

-   **Scope of mentoring**. During mentoring sessions, mentors will
    support you in discussing real-world applications of open science
    concepts, practices and tools, and in integrating them into your
    work. Mentors will:

    -   Provide constructive feedback on the project you applied with,
        for example, an open science strategy or data management plan.

    -   Answer specific questions about real-world applications of open
        science concepts and tools.

    -   Recommend resources and readings.

-   **How to make the most out of mentoring sessions:**

    -   ***Please be mindful of the session time*.**

    -   Share in advance any notes, thoughts or materials (any
        documentation you have developed as part of the cohort calls or
        for your project) you would like your mentor to read before the
        session.

    -   Take notes during the meeting - it will allow you to track your
        progress and come back to some good ideas you would exchange.

-   We encourage you to focus your questions on broader open science
    practices or tools, and how they apply to your work. For example,

    -   **Instead of:** *"Which software library is best to analyse
        plant distribution patterns?"*

> **Try:** *"How can I tell if a software package I want to use for my
> analyses meets the minimal reproducibility standards?"*

-   **Instead of:\
    ***\"Which dataset should I use to study the effects of climate
    change on crop yield?\"\
    ***Try:\
    ***\"How can I evaluate whether a dataset I want to use is openly
    accessible, ethically sourced, and properly licensed for my
    research?\"*

<!-- -->

-   **Additional support:**

    -   **Slack:** OLS is a big community, with people from different
        regions, disciplines and career levels. We encourage you to ask
        questions in the Slack channels, especially those that you may
        not be able to cover during mentoring sessions. More often than
        not, someone will point you to useful resources ðŸ˜‰

    -   **Contact** Malvika Sharan, cohort coordinator, for any
        questions you may have via Slack or email
        (malvika@we-are-ols.org).

### Before the first mentor meeting

-   Please read the email sent by OLS organisers to you.

-   Read about cohort calls and mentor-mentee calls on our resource
    page:
    [[https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/ols-9-dra/schedule.html]{.underline}](https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/ols-9-dra/schedule.html)

-   Create a [[GitHub account]{.underline}](https://github.com/) if you
    don't have one already

-   If can export this document in a different format to use in other
    shared document platforms like HackMD

    -   Get started with HackMD using this short guide:
        [[https://hackmd.io/@openlifesci/OLS-HackMD-guide]{.underline}](https://hackmd.io/@openlifesci/OLS-HackMD-guide)

#### Prepare for your mentoring meeting

1.  Take a Self-Assessment SURVEY (if haven\'t already) and share the
    outcome with their mentors during the call.

    -   Carry out self-assessment (use this template): [[\[MAKE A
        COPY\]\[OLS-9\] Week 1 -
        Self-Assessment.docx]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1hnwOWjpssgRc-YYk5b-j3f3Y92bxcO_D)

    -   \[Share your notes from the survey outcome\]

2.  Based on the insights gained from the survey, set 1-2 open science
    goals for yourself in OLS (it doesn't have to be about your
    project). (goal setting template: [[\[MAKE A COPY\] Week 02 -
    Goal-setting]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FhDM7bLvMfJcjm_2mheNzc8sZPZDJJBgUj5Zka49-8))

    -   \[Project lead 3 - Add your response here\]

3.  Open an issue on the OLS-9 repo where you will track your progress
    in this cohort:
    [[https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9]{.underline}](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-9)

    -   \[Link to Project 1 issue here\]

    -   \[Link to Project 2 issue here\]

    -   \[Link to Project 3 issue here\]

-   State how your mentor(s) can best support you in OLS (providing
    accountability, connecting them with the right people, sharing
    useful resources, and specific skills they can help them gain either
    directly or with the help of OLS experts)

    -   \[Project lead 1 - This could be a copy of what you wrote in
        your application\]

    -   \[Project lead 2 - This could be a copy of what you wrote in
        your application\]

    -   \[Project lead 3 - This could be a copy of what you wrote in
        your application\]

-   Start working on your Open Canvas
    ([[instructions]{.underline}](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/),
